## Machine Learning

## Project Description:

- Extracted the data from UCV Machine Learning Repository which contained the blood test results and demographic information of around 600 blood donors.
- Deployed Naive Baiyes Classifier as the baseline model and compared results obtained using Multiclass Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Achieved the lowest misclassification rate of 0.04 and highest accuracy in predicting whether a blood donor is a Hepatitis C patient or not using a random forest model


## Skills:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Manipulation and Data Cleaning
