## Machine Learning

## Project Description:

- Extracted the patient data from UCV Machine Learning Repository which contained the blood test results and demographic information of around 600 blood donors.
- Deployed supervised machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes Classifier, Multiclass Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to accurately predict
  whether a blood donor is a Hepatitis C patient or not.
- Compared the performance for every model and achieved the lowest misclassification rate of 0.04 and the highest accuracy rate of 98.7% using a Random Forest model


## Skills:
1. Data Extraction
2. Data Manipulation and Data Cleaning
3. Machine Learning Algorithms
